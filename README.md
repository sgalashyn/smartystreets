## Description

CFML wrapper library for [SmartyStreets LiveAddress API](http://www.smartystreets.com/Products/LiveAddress-API/), formerly Qualified Address.

There is a [RIAForge project](http://quaddress.riaforge.org/) for previous version wrapper, it uses v1 web-service.

## Requirements

Library uses modern CFScript syntax, so it requires at least Adobe ColdFusion 9 or Railo 3.2 engine to work. 

Check out old wrapper for ACF8 compatible integration, please be aware that API could have change since release.

## Usage Examples

First you need to register an account and [obtain your authentication token](https://www.smartystreets.com/Account/Api/Install/rest/).
SmartyStreets gives free 30-day trial with 500 requests, this should be enough for integration and testing.
